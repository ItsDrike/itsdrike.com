## Hi there!

Welcome to my personal website!

This is a convenient place where you can find all of my social media and details about me.
I also keep my personal blog here where I usually write about some technology I'm working with or really anything
that I find interesting.

## About me

I’m a developer mostly interested in Python, and in the process of learning Rust, but I’m also experimenting with some
x86 Linux NASM Assembly and C. I mostly like back-end work and algorithm design, since I'm terrible at making good
looking user interfaces.

I also enjoy DevOps and automation of everything with various CI workflows or scripts. Another thing that I've been
very passionate about is learning about Linux systems. I've made the switch to exclusively using Linux as my operating
system in May 2019, and since then I've tried out a lot of different software and distributions, (Kali, Debian, Ubuntu,
Fedora, Gentoo, LFS, Manjaro, Garuda, Artix, NixOS and probably a bunch of others that I don't even remember anymore),
but after a while, I've decided to settle on running Arch Linux with Hyprland.

As for my non-tech related interests, I really enjoy watching TV shows and movies, specifically, I like Fantasy
and Sci-Fi genres.
