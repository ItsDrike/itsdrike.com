## Hi there!

Welcome to my personal website!

This is a convenient place where you can find all of my social media and details about me.
I also keep my personal blog here where I usually write about some technology I'm working with or really anything
that I find interesting.

## About me

I’m a developer mostly interested in Python, but I’m currently experimenting with NASM Assembly and C. I mostly like
back-end work and algorithm design, since I'm terrible at making good looking user interfaces. 

I also enjoy DevOps and automation of everything with various CI workflows or scripts. However lately what I've been
most passionate about is certainly learning about Linux systems. I've made the switch to exclusively using GNU/Linux
as my operating system since 12.05.2019, and during that time I've tried out a lot of different software and 
distributions, but after a while, I've decided to settle on dual booting Gentoo Linux with Arch Linux.

As for my non-tech related interests, I really enjoy watching TV shows and movies, specifically, I like Fantasy
and Sci-Fi genres.
