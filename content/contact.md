Wanna contact me?

Since I do value my online privacy, you won't find me on pretty much any mainstream social media sites. However if you
do want to contact me, you can reach me using one of the details below:

- My Discord: {{< sociallink discord >}}
- Matrix: {{< sociallink matrix >}}
- E-Mail: {{< sociallink email >}}

Given I spend most of my life attached to some form of computer, I'm not a hard person to get hold of. If you do want
to contact me, please prefer the discord contact since I don't check my emails that often. I will get back to you on
them, but you may experience a delay of several days. On Matrix, the delay will likely be even longer, as I don't use
it as often anymore.
