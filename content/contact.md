So you want to contact me?

Since I do value my online privacy, you won't find my name and many other social networks you would be likely to find in other websites like these.
However if you do want to contact me, you can reach me using one of the details below:

- My Discrod: {{< sociallink discord >}}
- My Discord server: {{< sociallink discord-server >}}
- E-Mail: {{< sociallink email >}}


Given I spend most of my life attached to some form of computer, I'm not a hard person to get hold of. If you do want to contact me, please prefer the discord contact since
I don't check my emails that often. I will get back to you on them, but you may experience a delay of several days.
